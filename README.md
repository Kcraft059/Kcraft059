**Generally open to all kind of technology, so far, i've participated in little/personnal to medium sized project:**
- such as [a website](https://ftnetwork.duckdns.org) **(WIP)** fully coded, and configured by myself through a fully declarative NixOS setup featuring a simple LEMP stack.
- the translation of the [BetterDisplay App](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay) to french with the help of @MonolitheMedia.
- some little macOS scripts of my own.
