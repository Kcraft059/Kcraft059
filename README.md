## Me

So, as i said, **Hi there !!** </br>
But let's start with a few formalities first:

```yaml
# Few elements about me 
Name: Camille
Pronouns: they/them # TODO: debug genderd.service
Nationnality: 🇫🇷
Age: 16
Languages: # I don't master any of those 
 - C # I'm trying to focus on low-level compiled languages for now
 - Nix # Mainly for env config & dev shells
 - PHP # (alongside other front-end languages like JS)
 - Bash / Zsh
 - Python # I don't use it that much anymore
```
> Yeah… on the moment I thought this would look good… Yeah strange profile for a strange person…

Anyway, I'm Camille, I also go by `Kcraft⁰⁵⁹` online, I'm a french high-school student which codes in their free time. My english isn't perfect, but I love practicing it as much as I love talking to people.</br>
I'm open to all kind of technologies, I'm more interested in low-level programming for now. I use macOS (because it's unix-like) in combination with Nix-Darwin to fully configure my system in a reproducible way.

**But let's start at the beginning of my journey, shall we ?**

## My Journey
<details>
It started relatively simple, an old piece of junk : my `Late 2012 MacMini`. This piece of tech gave me the passion I have today for IT. After few teardowns & rebuilt of this computer, I figured I wanted to try experimenting a bit with it, after making it support new macOS versions, and having installed ubuntu, I started to understand the system more deeply. Tho it was not without mistakes… I did screw-up macOS instances a few time, and made several complete reinstall cycles a few time ^^' </br>
This is where it took a turn, I discovered nix, a reporducible & declarative package manager (this seemed perfect given how often i reinstalled macos). I made a config… this introduced me the hard way how to actually read documentation & understand the concepts of a language;

```nix
{pkgs, lib, ...} :
{
	
}

```
	
</details>

## Nowadays
**My 'projects' :**

- Low level [programing in C](<https://www.github.com/kcraft059/c-lang-playground>)
- An unfinished [website](<https://ftnetwork.duckdns.org/>)
-	A sketchybar [config](<https://www.github.com/kcraft059/sketchybar-config>)
-	A declartive Nix [config](<https://www.github.com/kcraft059/Nix-Config/>)
-	Help in the transaltion of [Better-Display](<https://www.github.com/waydabber/better-display>)

## TL;DR :

_I'm a silly kid trying to learn IT by themselves, I code on feekings, while never finishing any project and my learning method makes my code a bit unorthodox.
You might just wanna see ppl more talented than me... ^^'_

## Hardware / OSes

**Oses that I use :**
- [x] MacOS [Main] - managed through Nix-Darwin
- [x] NixOS - For my server
- [x] Windows - only when i'm forced to…
- [ ] Ubuntu - I don't really use it anymore
- [ ] Asahi Linux - _(I hope a release for M3 macs comes out !)_

**My hardware :**
- Laptop : [Arm64] `Macbook Air M3 (2024)`
- Server : [x86] `Mac Mini Late 2012` x2
- _And a lot more junk that doesn't need to be displayed here…_
