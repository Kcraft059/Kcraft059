## Me

So, as i said, Hi there !! (Yeah strange profile for a strange person…)
But let's start with a few formalities first:

```yaml
# Spec sheet
Name: Camille
Nationnality: 🇫🇷
Age: 16
```
Yeah… on the moment I thought this would look good…


**My 'projects' :**

- 
-
-

**TL;DR :**

_I'm a silly kid trying to learn IT by themselves, I code on feekings, while never finishing any project and my learning method makes my code a bit unorthodox.
You might just wanna see ppl more talented than me... ^^'_

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to contact me you can do it over Discord[^1], and expect an answer in the near 24h.

## Hardware / OSes

**Oses that I use :**
- [x] MacOS [Main] - managed through Nix-Darwin
- [x] NixOS - For my server
- [x] Windows - only when i'm forced to…
- [ ] Ubuntu - I don't really use it anymore
- [ ] Asahi Linux - _(I hope a release for M3 macs comes out !)_

**My hardware :**
- Laptop : [Arm64] `Macbook Air M3 (2024)`
- Server : [x86] `Mac Mini Late 2012` x2
- _And a lot more junk that doesn't need to be displayed here…_
