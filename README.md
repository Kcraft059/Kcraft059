<br>

I'm a french student ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· who gained interest in programming during the 2 last years.
I, in most cases have absolutely no problem talking fluently english.

_(**TL;DR**: I'm just a silly 16 years-old kid trying to learn IT/developement by themselves)_

<br>

**Generally open to all kind of technology, so far, i've participated in little/personnal to medium sized projects:**
- such as [a website](https://ftnetwork.duckdns.org) **(WIP)** fully coded, and configured by myself through a fully declarative NixOS setup featuring a simple LEMP stack.
- the translation of the [BetterDisplay App](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay) to french with the help of @MonolitheMedia.
- some little macOS scripts of my own.

## Hardware / OSes

**Oses that I use :**
- [x] MacOS [Main] - managed through Nix-Darwin
- [x] NixOS - For my server
- [x] Windows - only when i'm forced toâ€¦
- [ ] Ubuntu - I don't really use it anymore
- [ ] Asahi Linux - _(I hope a release for M3 macs comes out !)_

**My hardware :**
- Laptop : [Arm64] `Macbook Air M3 (2024)`
- Server : [x86] `Mac Mini Late 2012`
- _And a lot more junk that doesn't need to be displayed hereâ€¦_
